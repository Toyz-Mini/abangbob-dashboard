#### Test TC002
- **Test Name:** POS Order Processing with Valid Inputs
- **Test Code:** [TC002_POS_Order_Processing_with_Valid_Inputs.py](./TC002_POS_Order_Processing_with_Valid_Inputs.py)
- **Test Error:** The POS page at http://localhost:3000/ consistently shows the error message 'missing required error components, refreshing...' and does not load any interactive elements. This prevents logging in as POS Operator and performing any order processing tests. The issue has been reported. Task cannot proceed further and is now completed.

#### Test TC003
- **Test Name:** POS Order Processing with Invalid Inputs
- **Test Code:** [TC003_POS_Order_Processing_with_Invalid_Inputs.py](./TC003_POS_Order_Processing_with_Invalid_Inputs.py)
- **Test Error:** The POS system page at http://localhost:3000/ is not loading required components and shows a persistent error message 'missing required error components, refreshing...'. This prevents any interaction or testing of order validation including modifier selection, discount limits, and phone number format. The issue has been reported and testing cannot proceed until it is fixed.
